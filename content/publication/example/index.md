abstract: Riemannian manifolds provide a principled way to model nonlinear
  geometric structure inherent in data. A Riemannian metric on said manifolds
  determines geometry-aware shortest paths and provides the means to define
  statistical models accordingly. However, these operations are typically
  computationally demanding. To ease this computational burden, we advocate
  probabilistic numerical methods for Riemannian statistics. In particular, we
  focus on Bayesian quadrature (BQ) to numerically compute integrals over normal
  laws on Riemannian manifolds learned from data. In this task, each function
  evaluation relies on the solution of an expensive initial value problem. We
  show that by leveraging both prior knowledge and an active exploration scheme,
  BQ significantly reduces the number of required evaluations and thus
  outperforms Monte Carlo methods on a wide range of integration problems. As a
  concrete application, we highlight the merits of adopting Riemannian geometry
  with our proposed framework on a nonlinear dataset from molecular dynamics.
